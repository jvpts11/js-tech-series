 * Key routing for a full-screen computer program (the Network Management Studio, and future programs). Pure logic:
 * GLFW key codes are kept as literals so this carries no Minecraft/LWJGL types and is unit-tested directly.
 *
 * <p>The rule exists because of a real bug: a program runs inside a container screen, and the vanilla screen closes
 * itself when it sees the player's <em>inventory key</em> (which defaults to {@code E}). A program that types text
 * must therefore consume EVERY key itself and let only {@code Escape} close it, never falling through to the vanilla
 * handler. {@link #route} encodes exactly that: {@code Escape} closes, {@code F5} runs, everything else is the
 * program's own input.
