/**
 * What a run of held keys in Emacs asks for.
 *
 * <p>Emacs has no modes: every key types, and a command is a key held with Control or Meta, sometimes
 * two of them in a row. That second half is the part worth keeping honest, because {@code C-x C-s} and
 * {@code C-x C-c} differ by one key and do very different things, and a run that means nothing has to
 * be dropped rather than half-done.
 *
 * <p>The chord is read as text, which is what the editor already has to show in its echo area anyway,
 * so what a player is told they pressed and what actually happens are read from the same string.
