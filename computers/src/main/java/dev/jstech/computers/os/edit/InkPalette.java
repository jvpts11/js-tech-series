 * The colours a piece of source is painted in, one set for a light window and one for a dark one.
 *
 * <p>An editor sits on whatever ground its system gives it, and a colour that reads on cream is a
 * colour that vanishes on slate. So the two sets are written out separately rather than one being
 * derived from the other by arithmetic, which is how the unreadable middle greys got shipped before.
 * Every colour here is checked against its own ground by a test, so a change that makes a comment
 * disappear fails before anyone opens a monitor.
