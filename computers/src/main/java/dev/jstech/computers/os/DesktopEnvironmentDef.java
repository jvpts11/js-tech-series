/**
 * A desktop environment: the graphical shell a computer runs on top of its OS. The Frames editions bundle
 * their own (the id doubles as the OS id, so every Frames look and icon set keeps its key); a Linux
 * distribution boots to a TTY until one is installed as a package (KDE Plasma, GNOME, Cinnamon).
 *
 * <p>A desktop environment brings its chrome ({@link PanelStyle}), its skin and wallpaper (looked up by
 * {@link #id()} on the client), the built-in programs it bundles, and the native names those programs
 * show under it (Files is Dolphin on KDE and Nautilus on GNOME). Registered through
 * {@link JSComputersAPI}, so an add-on can ship its own.
 *
 * @param id               unique registry key (e.g. {@code jsc:kde_plasma}); Frames use their OS id
 * @param displayName      the human name
 * @param panelStyle       the chrome family the desktop screen draws
 * @param bundledPrograms  the pre-installed program ids this desktop shows launchers for, in rail order
 * @param nativeNames      per-program display-name overrides under this desktop (missing = the program's own)
 * @param house            who makes this desktop, and so who is credited for the programs it bundles
