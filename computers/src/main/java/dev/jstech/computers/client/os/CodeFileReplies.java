/**
 * Where a file the server sent back belongs, when more than one window could have asked for it.
 *
 * <p>The Editor and the file explorer each kept the one instance of themselves and took whatever
 * arrived, which worked while they were the only two. A code editor asks for the same things, so an
 * answer meant for it would have landed in the Editor's buffer and quietly replaced what the player had
 * open there.
 *
 * <p>An editor says here what it is waiting for, by name, before it asks. An answer is handed over only
 * when it is the answer to that question; anything else falls through to the explorer and the Editor
 * exactly as it did before. Waiting on a name rather than on the next reply matters because the two ask
 * for different things at the same time: a listing the explorer wanted must never satisfy an editor
 * that asked about another folder, or the editor takes an answer that was not its and the explorer is
 * left with none.
