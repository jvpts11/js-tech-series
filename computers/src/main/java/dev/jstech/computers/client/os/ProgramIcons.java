 * Draws a program's icon from its texture. Each program ships a real 16x16 pixel-art sprite per Frames edition
 * at {@code textures/gui/program/<program>/<os>.png}, genuinely different artwork per era, not a recolour:
 * Frames 95 is chunky outlined pixel art, Frames XP is glossy Luna pixel art, Frames 11 is flat two-tone pixel
 * art. The blit is keyed by the program id, so an add-on that ships a sprite at this convention path is drawn
 * with no code change here.
 *
 * <p>Every sprite is drawn at its native 16 pixels, 1:1, centered in the requested box, never resampled.
 * The only scaling is the game's own uniform GUI scale, which keeps the pixels crisp exactly like item icons.
 * An unknown or null id falls back to the {@code generic} sprite so a launcher never shows a missing texture.
