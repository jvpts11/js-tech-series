/**
 * What reaching out of a program costs it.
 *
 * <p>A Cannon program is given a share of the tick to spend, and an instruction that only moves numbers
 * about inside it costs one. Asking the machine something costs more, because the machine has to go and
 * look: a glance at what the computer is costs a little, reading the network costs more, and asking the
 * network to actually do something costs most of all. A program that sweeps everything every tick should
 * feel it.
 *
 * <p>The numbers live here so an editor can tell the player what a line will cost before they write it,
 * which is the whole point of an editor knowing the language. What the machine charges is checked
 * against this by a test on a real computer, so the two can never quietly drift apart.
