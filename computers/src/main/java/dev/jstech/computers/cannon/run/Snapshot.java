/**
 * A running program, frozen.

 * <p>A process that stopped because the world was put away should carry on where it left off when the
 * world comes back, which means everything it was holding has to be written down: what it had
 * allocated, what each frame was doing, and where each of them was in its method.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is plain data with no Minecraft in it, so freezing and thawing can be tested on
 * its own, and whatever writes it to a save file is a thin layer over records that already hold the
 * whole truth. References between allocated things become numbers, because two objects can point at
 * each other and a tree cannot say that.
