/**
 * Every instruction of the assembly, and the one operand each of them takes.
 *
 * <p>The machine works on a stack: an instruction takes what it needs off the top and leaves its
 * result there. That is what keeps the listing short enough to read down a screen, and it is why
 * there is no instruction here that names two places at once.
 *
 * <p>Every instruction costs one from a process's budget for the tick, except a call into the
 * library or into the world, which costs what that call is documented to cost.
 *
 * <p>{@code ldfn} is the one that makes a handler: it takes the object a method belongs to off the
 * stack and leaves a delegate bound to it, which is what a method handed over without brackets, and
 * what a lambda, both come to in the end.
