/**
 * Pure layout for the Network Management Studio, with no Minecraft dependency so {@link #layout()} is
 * unit-tested. The Studio mirrors a classic SSMS window: a title strip, a menu bar, a toolbar, then the
 * body split into an Object Explorer column on the left and, on the right, a dominant query editor over a
 * smaller results grid, with a blue status bar across the bottom. Two splitter bands (vertical between the
 * explorer and the right pane, horizontal between editor and grid) are where the player will later drag to
 * resize.
 *
 * <p>The validated boxes are the macro regions, and they tile the window edge-to-edge and must never overlap
 * nor spill out. The editor is deliberately the tallest body region (the editor dominates the screen). All
 * coordinates are relative to the window's top-left corner; the screen adds {@code leftPos}/{@code topPos}
 * at draw time and the screen draws every region from these same constants.
