/**
 * Pure grid math for free-positioned desktop icons, with no Minecraft dependency so it can be unit-tested.
 *
 * <p>Every icon occupies one grid cell identified by a column and a row, packed into a single int
 * ({@code col << 16 | row}) so a single value persists and travels over the wire. A desktop lays icons out
 * top-down within a column, then continues in the next column to the right. An icon the player has dropped
 * somewhere ("pinned") keeps its stored cell; the rest flow into the first cell no pinned icon already
 * claims. Resolving both kinds in one pass means the draw and the hit-test always agree on where an icon is.
