 * A language the computers of this world can be programmed in.

 * <p>One of these is everything the machines need in order to treat a language as their own: what its
 * files are called, how to turn source into something runnable, how to colour it in an editor, and how
 * to start and restore a running program. An addon that registers one gets the prompt, the file
 * explorer, the terminal, the task manager, saving and the tick budget without writing any of them.
 *
 * <p>What it does NOT include is how the language works. Nothing here says anything about types,
 * memory or instructions: a language that compiles to something else entirely, or interprets its source
 * directly, fits this just as well.
