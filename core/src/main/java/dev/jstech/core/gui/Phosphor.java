/**
 * A monochrome monitor has one colour.
 *
 * <p>The tube of the Vintage era is a green-phosphor CRT: every pixel it can light is the same green,
 * brighter or dimmer. Screens that run on such a monitor were written with the full palette anyway:
 * white headings, cyan system lines, red errors, amber warnings, which no monitor of that decade could
 * have shown. This maps any colour to what that tube would actually display: the phosphor, lit in
 * proportion to how bright the original colour reads. Errors stay legible because red is dim and
 * headings still stand out because white is full brightness, so the meaning survives the filter.
 *
 * <p>Pure maths, no rendering: the screens call it, and a unit test can check it.
