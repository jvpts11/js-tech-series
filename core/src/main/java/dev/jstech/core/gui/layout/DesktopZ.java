/**
 * The fixed Z (depth) of every desktop render layer, back-to-front. In 1.21.1 {@code GuiGraphics} batches
 * text and renders it last (over everything), so a back layer's text (e.g. a desktop icon's label) bleeds
 * on top of a front layer (an open window) when every layer draws at the same depth. Flushing the batch
 * between layers does not work outside a managed draw, so instead each layer draws at its own Z via
 * {@code pose().translate(0, 0, z)}; the depth buffer then keeps a back layer strictly behind a front one,
 * regardless of the text batch order. This mirrors how the rest of the mod's screens order their overlays.
 *
 * <p>The values are strictly increasing, back-to-front, with deliberate gaps: a layer that draws items with
 * {@code renderItem} needs ~{@link #ITEM_DEPTH} units of headroom before the next layer so the item model's
 * depth cannot poke through. {@link #TOOLTIP} is fixed at 400 because the vanilla tooltip renderer translates
 * +400 internally; the surrounding layers are arranged so a tooltip lands correctly above the windows and
 * the taskbar without anyone applying an extra translate to it. Pure constants holder so {@link #ordered()}
 * can be asserted strictly increasing (and item layers gap-respecting) in a unit test.
