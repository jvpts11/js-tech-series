/**
 * A pure, Minecraft-free model of a screen's layout, so the layout can be unit-tested. A screen builds
 * its element rectangles here and the validators catch the layout bugs that previously only surfaced
 * in-game: solid elements overlapping, anything spilling past the panel, and text running wider than the
 * space it sits in. It lives in {@code common} (not {@code client}) because both the Menu (which places
 * the real slots) and the Screen (which draws their frames) consume the same layout, so the slot
 * positions are validated too.
 *
 * <p>Elements come in two kinds, because not every overlap is a bug:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #box}, a <em>solid</em> element (slot, button, panel, icon). Two solids must never
 *       overlap, and a solid must stay inside the panel.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #text}, a line of text. Text is routinely drawn <em>on top of</em> a panel or centered
 *       in a button, so it is excluded from the overlap check; it is only required to stay inside the
 *       panel (a label that runs off the edge is the real bug).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Font metrics are approximated: a vanilla glyph is about {@value #GLYPH_WIDTH} px wide and a line
 * about {@value #LINE_HEIGHT} px tall at scale 1.0. The exact rendered width of a string still needs the
 * real font in-client, but the estimate reliably catches gross overflow. The font SIZE enters the check
 * through the {@code scale} on each text line.
